    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A quick, reliable way to fry eggs: heat a skillet, add a little butter or
      oil, crack the eggs in, and cook until the whites are set and the yolks
      reach your desired doneness. Season simply with salt and pepper and serve
      hot.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs (per person)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp butter or neutral oil</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Optional: chopped parsley or chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add butter or oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
      <li>
        Crack eggs into the pan (or into a bowl first, then slide into the pan).
      </li>
      <li>Cook until the whites are set; for sunny-side-up, do not flip.</li>
      <li>
        For over-easy, carefully flip and cook 10–30 seconds more; for
        over-hard, cook longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper, garnish if desired, and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
